//! What the machine does, asked of a real microVM.
//!
//! Every test here writes a document to a host built the way `nibrunnerd serve` builds one, and
//! then asks the guest — through the proxy, on the wire — whether the invariant held. The unit
//! suite proves what the daemon decides; these prove what happens once a kernel, a hypervisor and
//! a tenant are involved.
//!
//! Each one asks for a multi-threaded runtime: a host that a panicking test never stopped takes
//! its guests down as it is dropped, and blocking on that needs a runtime with another thread to
//! put the work on.
//!
//! They need Linux, root, `/dev/kvm`, `nft`, `mke2fs`, a guest image from `just guest-image` and
//! the tenant from `just integration-guest`. An enabled run fails if its fixtures are missing;
//! ordinary `just test` skips this suite. `just integration-guest` is the way in.
